# calculator
A basic calculator that accepts input from onscreen buttons and uses those to perform basic operations.

Features to add: only 1 decimal allowed; add a backspace button.

Known bugs: clicking a number after calculating with equals has no effect. It should clear all memory to allow starting again.
